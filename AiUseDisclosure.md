While working on this project, we used a few different tools to help streamline the development process and ensure accuracy. ChatGPT was a great resource for writing and refining code, fixing errors, setting up API endpoints, and improving the integration between FastAPI and Streamlit. I also used Perplexity AI to research technical solutions, cross-check information, and gather relevant resources to make sure everything was on the right track. Additionally, DeepSeek helped with analyzing technical documentation and enhancing the data extraction process. These tools made the development process smoother and more efficient, helping me troubleshoot issues faster and build a more reliable application.
